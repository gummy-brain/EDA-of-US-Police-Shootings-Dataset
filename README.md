# EDA of US Police Shootings Dataset

This project was prepared while studying at Turing College. The objectives were to:

- identify opportunities for data analysis;
- perform EDA;
- work with data from Kaggle;
- visualize data with Matplotlib & Seaborn;
- read data, perform queries, and filter data using Pandas.

The [Fatal Police Shootings in the U.S. '15 - '17](https://www.kaggle.com/washingtonpost/police-shootings) dataset from Kaggle was the cornerstone of this analysis. Additionally, the population data from [2016 US Census](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/distribution-by-raceethnicity/?dataView=1&currentTimeframe=3&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) was used to get more profound insights.
